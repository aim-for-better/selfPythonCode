The inflation then progresses away from the ankle at the same time as the upper part of the bladder is being inflated. When the bladder (41, 49) is inflated to the operating pressure, the blood vessels of the leg are constricted.", "number": "8925112", "lawyer": [], "id": "8925112", "foreigncitation": [], "title": "Aircrew ensembles", "usapplicationcitation": [], "usreldoc": [{"status": null, "kind": "A1", "relationship": null, "sequence": "0", "country": "US", "doctype": "related_publication", "number": "20130174310", "date": null, "rel_id": "20130174310"}], "num_claims": "12", "filename": "ipg150106.xml\r", "application": {}, "type": "utility", "assigne": [], "date": "2015-01-06", "uspatentcitation": [], "inventor": [], "nber": [], "kind": "B2", "country": "US", "cpc": [{"category": "additional", "group": {"title": "EQUIPMENT FOR FITTING IN OR TO AIRCRAFT; FLYING SUITS; PARACHUTES; ARRANGEMENTS OR MOUNTING OF POWER PLANTS OR PROPULSION TRANSMISSIONS IN AIRCRAFT"}, "sequence": "1", "section_id": "B", "subsection": {"title": "AIRCRAFT; AVIATION; COSMONAUTICS"}, "subgroup": {"title": "Flying suits -Anti-g suits or garments"}}, {"category": "invention", "group": {"title": "EQUIPMENT FOR FITTING IN OR TO AIRCRAFT; FLYING SUITS; PARACHUTES; ARRANGEMENTS OR MOUNTING OF POWER PLANTS OR PROPULSION TRANSMISSIONS IN AIRCRAFT"}, "sequence": "0", "section_id": "B", "subsection": {"title": "AIRCRAFT; AVIATION; COSMONAUTICS"}, "subgroup": {"title": "Flying suits "}}], "ipcr": [{"classification_data_source": "H", "sequence": "0", "section": "B", "classification_level": "A", "ipc_version_indicator": "2006-01-01", "symbol_position": "F", "subclass": "G", "classification_status": "B", "action_date": "2015-01-06", "ipc_class": "64", "main_group": "6", "classification_value": "I", "subgroup": "00"}, {"classification_data_source": "H", "sequence": "1", "section": "B", "classification_level": "A", "ipc_version_indicator": "2006-01-01", "symbol_position": "L", "subclass": "D", "classification_status": "B", "action_date": "2015-01-06", "ipc_class": "64", "main_group": "10", "classification_value": "I", "subgroup": "00"}], "uspc": [{"mainclass": {"title": "APPAREL"}, "subclass": {"title": "Astronauts body cover"}}]}
